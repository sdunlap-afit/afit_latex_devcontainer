\section{Include TikZ Graph}

This graph is an idea I was toying around with, but I have not tried it yet.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\include{graph}
\caption{Factor Graph with Timestamp Estimation}
\label{fig:factor_graph}
\end{figure}


\section{Include DrawIO Graph}

This graph is in ../drawio/factor_graph_1.drawio. If the graph file is updated, compile this document again (ctrl+s or hit play) to see the changes. Converting from .drawio to .pdf is done automatically if the drawio file changes, so it takes a bit longer to compile the first time after a change.

If you decide to publish this document, comment out the drawio package and uncomment the \verb|\newcommand| line above. This will include the .pdf file directly instead of converting from .drawio to .pdf on the fly. When submitting, make sure to include the .pdf files.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includediagram{../drawio/factor_graph_1}
\caption{Factor Graph with Timestamp Estimation}
\label{fig:factor_graph_1}
\end{figure}
